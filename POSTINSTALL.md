This application integrates with Cloudron authentication.

To store connection data of custom permissions for Cloudron users, a Guacamole account with the same username needs to be created. 

There is a default admin user in Guacamole with the following credentials:

* Username: `guacadmin`
* Password: `guacadmin` 

**Please change the admin password on first login**
